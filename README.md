README:
---------
Neon Pulse Platformer is a fast-paced, playable retro-cyber arcade action platformer themed around an ultra-addictive “Energy Hunt” challenge in a futuristic city where you collect “plasma tokens,” dodge electrical traps/robotic obstacles, and race for high scores. Game logic is modular for expansion. All assets and controls are inline. No blockchain/Web3 needed.

CONTROLS:
----------
- Arrow keys / WASD: Move left/right, jump, crouch.
- Space: Activate slow-mo pulse (limited charge).
- Touch: On-screen buttons for movement and jump.
- Collect blue “plasma tokens” for score.
- Avoid orange hazard tiles, laser walls, or robot drones!
- Reach checkpoints to unlock new zones. Score is displayed.

RULES:
-------
Collect as many plasma tokens as possible before time runs out or health is depleted. Obstacles (robots, lasers, shock pads) subtract health. Collect tokens and power-ups for bonus time or points. Try for the highest score and unlock neon-powered achievements!

TECH:
------
- Built with Three.js (latest), modularized for expansion.
- Neon synthwave color palette (purple, cyan, magenta, gold).
- 2D SVGS for platforms/coins with 3D effects/shaders.
- Startup splash screen with logo, rules, and controls.
- Keyboard & responsive touch controls.

EXPANDABLE MODULES:

Have fun and enjoy the neon rush!
